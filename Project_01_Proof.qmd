```{r setup, echo=T, output=F}
library(tidyverse)
```

This is the beginning of our project. 

Outline:\
- Data Processing Functions\
  1. Select Specific Columns\
  2. Convert Data into long format\
  3. Parse/Pull year, convert year to numeric value AND get first 3chr, last 4num; mutate\
  4. Create two new data sets\
  5. Create new var in country tibble\
  6. Create new var in non-country tibble\
- Combining Data Functions\
  1. Write function that does 1&2 in Data Proc step\
  2. Write function that receives output from 2 and does 3 with it.\
  3. Write function for step 5\
  4. Write function for step 6\
  5. Write function for output of 3,5, and 6; returns two Tibbles.\
  6. Wrap it into one function\
  7. Call function twice for each .csv file\
  8. Function combines output of both tibbles into one dataset\
- Generic Functions\
  1. Write function that plots mean across years by division.  \
  2. Plot function itemized list; spec state, determine top/bottom, how many.\
  3. Finalize Plot Function with additional asks.\
- Putting it all together\
  Exhausting list of tests against all the functions we made in the first three sections. \
